            <h2> 
                    •	What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h2>
                <br>
                Coding is pretty tough and like any language, take so much time to sort out and cannot be done alone.                <br> 
            <h2> 
                    •	What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </h2>
                <br>
                Not sure about surprises. Maybe the fact that it is a motivator in different areas because it puts things into perspective, such as, what the hell am I doing now.    <br>
            <h2>
                    •	What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h2>
                <br>
                I think the hardest thing was concentrating at times, due to the content being far too long winded in parts and therefore tiring. It is very difficult to maintain a sane mind and awake body when what you are looking at starts to drone on. It is what I would see as a good form of torture in the long term or in the way that depression can beat you down with the same shit, over and over and no obvious way out, meaning you fall even further into a pit of despair.               
                <br>
            <h2>
                    •	Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h2>
                <br>               
                The core is clearly about testing the will and the adaptability into a field that has monotony at its core. Not that it is boring but that it can be very repetitive and can drive you mad. It is similar in the way that editing might sound cool but you then have to archive and organise everything you have worked on for a time when you may but probably we never work on again. I have seen breakdowns and tantrums in the work place and they are stem from a lack of communication and people not feeling valued or seeing their self-worth. Another reason is likely that many of those that have, in the past, chosen to be in this area have been what was always considered nerdy, lame wads or poindexters. The reality however is more that those that are autistic or have aspergers, in the 90s and above on the spectrum, tend to be drawn to these fields due to the innate lack of ability to communicate effectively and not able to see or read people as a normie can. 
            <h2> 
                    •	Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.         </h2>
                    <br>
                    That is a question with many positive and negative answers no matter how you look at it. Some of the core was interesting and makes you think but then if it didn’t make you think, then you would be like those rats I caught. Sure I knew the consequences of catching them and having to kill them with a shovel, and bury them because traps don’t always do the full job but that is life. You take the good, you take the bad, the facts of life, those are the facts of life. <br>
