            <br> <h2>  •	What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2><br>
            EQ is a misnomer and is often hijacked by a radical left leaning society to instil the idea that it is 100% correct. As it has the word “Emotional” it is frowned upon being negative towards it as you will be seen as a mean person that cares only for power and money. This is a tool in which people divide into new groups because even though they want to quash the old mean groups or ways, there is always a need to identify and list things. Instead of the old ones of race, gender and religion etc.
            A better way to describe EQ would be “AI” as in “All Intelligence”. This allows for the ideas of logic and critical thinking as well and being disagreeable and agreeable on all things and anything with and without the input of others.
            <br> <h2>  •	How is it different to IQ?</h2><br>
            IQ was a test to tell if someone was smart or not but can never be studied due to the fact that you would have to test based on race, gender, economic and freedom biases. It is a very flawed test as you can study for the test and gain a high IQ. It should probably be a “personal logic and reason test” That would give the main difference of personal vs interpersonal.
            <br> <h2> • Why is it important?</h2><br>
            These are tests and only ever important if the goal is to get a certain grade or mark. It is also tough to test someone’s “emotion” if they are having a bad day or just tired, just as it is to test intelligence. They serve no other importance except for self-gratification.
