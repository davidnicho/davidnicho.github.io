        <h2 class=center>Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>   <b> •	What is your long term goal and or career pathway?<br></b>
            Long term goals are to finish with current working situation and move towards a more technical area such as coding or networking
        <br> <br> <b>  •	What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?<br></b>
            Working on projects as a team. Being able to lead and follow the teams.
        <br> <br> <b>  •	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.<br></b>
            Help can be found in many ways but in a learning situation should only be done after at least trying some solutions. It may take longer but trial and error teach more than simply being told.
        <br> <br> <b>  •	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br></b>
            The team must be around when they say they will be. They must be patient and not cynical because they know what to do and must understand that no one will learn, teach or even try in the same way. Some charge ahead, some sit back and ponder others will seemingly ignore everything but in that way are processing their own way.
        <br> <br> <b>  •	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.<br></b>
            TBA.
        <br> <br> <b>  •	For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.<br></b>
            Morning drop offs will be a problem.
