<h1>As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:</h1> 
<p>
<h2>•	An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
Hasn’t this been done before? HTML is the actor and CSS is the makeup artist.
<br>
<h2>•	Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h2>
You have to have things run and move forward. Even *.run did that and nothing has changed. The difference is new names and outputs. The looping is needed to make sure the code runs, continues and stops when criteria has been met. Like the encore for a band.
<br>
<h2>•	Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
It is what the site is. Not all the coding but what it is.
<br>
<h2>•	Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
Arrays are objects that have an array of values or information while the object is almost everything in JavaScript, sans a primitive unless they have been defined as an object.
<br>
<h2>•	Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
Functions are the worker bees of the hives. People only pay attention to the honey but the bee is there making things run when called to do so by the queen or the user of the interface.
