                    Life is not static and changes all the time, just as the mind. Starve yourself for a day and new neural pathways will be formed so you can figure out new ways to find food and in the same way, new information is processed by old processes but when that is not working, brains, not being static will create new pathways to process the information.

                    I try to ignore the old adage that “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” because the fact is that old dogs are just stubborn and have already done many things so why change.

                    Trying new things and pushing outside your comfort zones while pushing yourself to extremes to test your resolve and perseverance.
