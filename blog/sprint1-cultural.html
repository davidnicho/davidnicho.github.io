        <h2 class=center>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
            <br> <br> <b> •	A description of your own strengths and limitations<br></b>
                My main strengths are that I like to do new things and make new and interesting things. Main limitations are that I can get stuck in a situation and can’t find my way out of it. 
            <br> <br> <b> •	Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.<br></b>
                As long as things are going in a forward direction there is no issue. I find that when they are not going in the right direction I will close off from others and try to work it out, unless it is about working together then I will sit back and listen and observe, hopefully able to connect the dots. When all else fails I will take a break, leave the work area and just clear out. This could upset some people who think I am giving up but the fact is, hitting your head against a door over and over may work but it will hurt and sometimes the best solution is to sit back and completely ignore the problem and come back to it with a clear mind.
