<h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1> 
<p>
<h2>There are five different position properties at this time, the two not being looked at are static, which is the default and sticky which sticks to a position via the use of relative and fixed.</h2>
</p>
<b>Relative</b> is to where its normal position is. So if you move it up for example, other elements will not fill the normal position of the moved, relative element. It belongs to it so you better leave there stuff alone.
<p>
<b>Fixed</b> is fixed to a spot and won’t move because it is stubborn. <br>Other elements can move past it without any issue and it basically looks like it is floating on top of everything else. <br>Like those annoying side panels that sometimes pop out and never go away because they are fixed and want you to share the content you are suddenly closing because if you can’t see all the page, why bother with it.
</p>
<b>Absolute</b> is kind of like fixed but is fixed to an element or parent because it is a child that needs to be comforted and told where to go. If the parent goes to the right then the absolute child will follow, clinging onto the parents legs and not letting them go. As a child, the absolute will cling onto whatever it see as a parental figure and its last resort is to hang onto the state for help or the document it is on and moves with the page.
