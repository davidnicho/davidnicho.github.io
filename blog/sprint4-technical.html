  <h1>  Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h1> 
      <p>
    <h2>•	Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      There was a time I was trying to do this super simple code thing, hey wake up, stories about things you don’t care about are always fun. So it turned out you have to add a semicolon at the end of the line but it took me so long to try and do everything else first and hey, why are you running away? I felt stupid through the whole thing but learnt to do those little things!      
        <br>
    <h2>•	Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
      Nothing elegant about bashing ones head against a keyboard and hiring a group of monkeys to bash away at typewriters to eventually get it right.
        <br>
  <h1>•	Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h1>
    <h2>•	Pseudocode</h2>  
        This makes sense as it is just logical thought before having to actually add the real syntax, which one can never remember.
        <br>
    <h2>•	Trying something.</h2>
        Tried many things. About 90% of the trying was failiure but at least it wasn't 100%
          <br>
    <h2>•	Rubber ducky method.</h2>
        This is interesting that it is an actual method. It has always just been part of my thought and writing process over the years. I tend to talk to myself in my head all the time but as a rule, you do process those thoughts better if spoken out loud.
          <br>
    <h2>•	Reading error messages.</h2>
        Not all there. One does not just simply understand everything.
          <br>
    <h2>•	Console.logging.</h2>
        This is a good thing but I never know if it is in the right place or that it might be secretly messing things up because surely errors have nothing to do with my mistakes.
          <br>
    <h2>• Googling.</h2>
        Hello Google my old friend. I've come for answers from you again.
          <br>
    <h2>•	Asking your peers for help</h2>
        I like to do things for myself and don't really like to do that over the net. In person I am much more likely to ask peers for help.
          <br>
    <h2>•	Asking coaches for help.</h2>
        Pull up a chair. This is going to take a while.  
          <br>
    <h2>•	Improving your process with reflection.</h2>
        Thinking about it helps. It can clear the mind and help to put things together.
