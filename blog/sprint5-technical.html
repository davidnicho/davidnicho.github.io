  <h1>  Consider the following and answer the questions in bold:</h1> 
      <p>
    <h2>•	What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    After gaining many skills and abilities in this area, I intend to find something in a position of power or a position to make extra money to make things. I don’t have a desire to become an 80 hour week person or move from where I am because I am already here and I have a life outside of work. I would be open to working on projects and new ideas or even investing in them at the same time to make something happen because sometimes you have to put in a few to make something.        
    <br>
    <h2>•	What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
    My main limitations is perhaps time and that I truly hate social media, which is why I don’t use them. Cesspools of shit. That can also be a strength I guess because I avoid the soul sucking dribble that comes from it.
    <br>

    
    <h2>•	What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>  
    I may have issues with time at some points, as it is coming into winter and having to deal with sick kids can be an issue, not just the caring for but the getting of whatever is going around school. I believe I will be the oldest and even old enough to be some of the students’ parents age so that will create a barrier and issue with some.
    <br>
    <h2>•	What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
    When it comes to these sorts of skills, I would be most interested in leadership, diplomacy, intervention and influencing skills. Not the ones where we all sit around singing cumbiar but ones that are actually effective on “humans”. Far too often people push a system that is just about appeasement and making sure everyone’s feelings are OK.          <br>
    <h2>•	What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    Support is looking and helping, being aware of issues before they arise and actually knowing and doing what is needed. Anything overly ‘red tapey’ and sensitive is something I don’t expect want to have to deal with.
    <br>
    <h2>•	What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
    I expect to be working most of the time. I don’t do lunch breaks or coffees at the café and I tend to not eat in the day unless I am physical. I certainly won’t be hanging out doing meditation and I probably won’t be making best friends because most people will be on a different path to me. I am a loner and always have been because in the same way that people give people energy, I find too many people and interaction drain me. I am a bit aspergers.
    <br>
    I will ask for help but if it seems like I am lost, then it would be great if tutors could lend a hand. I don’t need encouragement and actually resent it some of the times as it is just something I should be able to do.
    <br>
    If people start making issues, I will be the first to stand up and deal with it in a calm and open way cause no one got time for other people’s shit. I have 10 years classroom control and have had to apprehend a classroom invader in the past. I stay calm under pressure so that I can think. Thinking is how you get out of all situations successfully.
